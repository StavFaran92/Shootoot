ShooToot is 2 player-1 mobile game where you and your friend will battle to the death! you do that by pressing the buttons by the rythm and choosing your actions wisely, are you up for the challenge???

The push region(1) is used to visualize the song’s rythm, it moves from right to left, it can be either red or green, when the push region hits the indicator (the yellow line) it means that both players should now act.
this is how the players can acts: if the push region was red (1) before turning 
blue (2) then the player should click the push button (4) if it was green (3) then he should choose an action (5-7), if you fail to press the push button when the red region turns blue or when the 
indicator is not touching a region you will not be able to pick an action!
both players start with 3 lives and 1 bullet, you can reload (5) to get an extra bullet,  but then you leave yourself open to other player’s attacks,also  you cannot have more than 6 bullets, you can choose to defend(6) which will save you from losing health if the other player chose to shoot you, or you can choose to shoot (7) the other player, make sure though you have enough bullet first(8) as it will cost you one, and hope that the other player did not defend, if you lose all your health (9) you will lose, finally to get back to main menu use (10).
